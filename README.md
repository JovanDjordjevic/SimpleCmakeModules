# SimpleCmakeModules

A collection of cmake modules I made.These include:

- `brutal-compiler-options` - Module for enabling most of the warning/error flags during compilation (a lot of them are not enabled with default `-Wall -Wextra` that is commonly used). Currently supported compilers:
  - GNU ver > 9.0
